 kickstarter-analysis Written Report

Overview of Project

This project is mainly designed to teach us how to analyze massive data by using Excel tools such as pivot tables and line charts.

Purpose

This project is mainly used to show how different factors are impacting the campaign results of Louise's play "Fever".

Analysis and Challenges

I Learned how to use excel data analytics tool by going over module 1 step by step and gained hands on experience by following the videos and insturctions. The difficulties I encountered was in Assignment 2 within this module challenge, where I input the wrong ranges for "countif" functions, I did not include the beignning and ending numbers of each number range, this results in discrepancies with the final result provided by the instruction guide.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The plays lauched in theater had huge successful rate in the middle fo the year, mainly in May. June and July. Meanwhile. the plays lauched in theater had realtively consistent failure rate regardless of the launch date across the whwole year.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The trend of of the successful rate decreased gradually first, when reaching the range 20000 to 29999 it became increasign trend, then there was a sharp decrease after the goal reached to 44999. The failure rate increased gradually and after the goal hit 29999, it decreased gradually, meaning that when the goal became higher, the failure rate actually became lower.

Limitation of the Dataset

The two charts can only show the relationship between one factor to the successful or failure rate of the campaign, more factors should be included.

Other possible tables

Other possible tables we could create include bar charts and piecharts that wil show clearer comparison or percentage occupation reaults realted to compaign.
